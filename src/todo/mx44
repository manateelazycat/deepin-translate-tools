{'en': {'shortDesc': 'polyphonic, multichannel midi realtime software synthesizer', 'pkgName': 'mx44', 'longDesc': u'The Mx44 is a polyphonic multichannel midi realtime software synthesizer. It is written in C and hand optimized for the (Intel) MMX instruction set. It runs under Linux, using any kernel modified for realtime performance.\n\nThe core algorithm is a  4 x 4 crossmodulating matrix (phase and amplitude) with individual envelopes for each oscillator. Oscillators have individual frequency intonation, can emphasize any of the eight first harmonics and even do some internal crossmodulation. Envelopes can be switched between VCA and VCF modes (ehrm, actually wave-shaping, but it will quack like a duck by any other name.) The sustainloop of the envelope can be brought into oscillation in the audible spectre as well as provide slow LFO sweeps. There is also a minor load of key and velocity related modifications for wowie zowie realtime ecstacy emulation.\n\nHomepage: http://hem.passagen.se/ja_linux/'}}
