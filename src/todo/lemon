{'en': {'shortDesc': 'The Lemon Parser Generator', 'pkgName': 'lemon', 'longDesc': u'Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or embedded controllers.'}}
