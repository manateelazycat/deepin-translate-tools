{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Graphical dungeon crawling game', 'pkgName': 'powder', 'longDesc': u'This is a roguelike originally developed specifically for the Gameboy Advance (GBA). It is not a port of an existing roguelike as the controls of the GBA are very different from the traditional keyboard, and the screen imposes some additional limitations. It is built around replayability and long term ergonomics, not short term learning. It uses actual graphic tiles (16x16) rather than the traditional characters.'}}
