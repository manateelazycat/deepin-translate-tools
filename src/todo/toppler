{'en': {'shortDesc': 'clone of the "Nebulus" game on old 8 and 16 bit machines', 'pkgName': 'toppler', 'longDesc': u'Toppler is an almost complete reimplementation of the old game known as Tower Toppler or Nebulus.\n\nThe target of the game is to reach the target door of each of the  8 towers in currently 2 missions with this little green animal. This door is usually at the very top of the tower.\n\nBut finding the way by using elevators and walking through a maze of doors and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve. There are a bunch of other creatures living on the tower that will hinder you to reach your target by pushing you over the edge of the platforms.'}}
