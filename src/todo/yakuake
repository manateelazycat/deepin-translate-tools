{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a Quake-style terminal emulator based on KDE Konsole technology', 'pkgName': 'yakuake', 'longDesc': u'YaKuake is inspired from the terminal in the Quake game: when you press a key (by default F12, but that can be changed) a terminal window slides down from the top of the screen. Press the key again, and the terminal slides back.\n\nIt is faster than a keyboard shortcut because it is already loaded into memory and as such is very useful to anyone who frequently finds themselves switching in and out of terminal sessions.'}}
