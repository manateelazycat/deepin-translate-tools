{'en': {'shortDesc': 'fantasy turn-based strategy game - complete suite (branch 1.8)', 'pkgName': 'wesnoth-1.8', 'longDesc': u'This package depends on the complete set of packages built from the wesnoth source package but the server (which can be found in the wesnoth-1.8-server package), most helpful if you always want to have all the official campaigns installed.  If you only want to play over the network with other players or want to play only a few campaigns you just need to install the wesnoth-1.8-core package and the wanted campaign packages.\n\nBattle for control of villages, using variety of units which have advantages and disadvantages in different types of terrains and against different types of attacks.  Units gain experience and advance levels, and are carried over from one scenario to the next in a campaign.'}}
