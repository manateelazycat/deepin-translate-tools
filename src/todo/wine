{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (meta package)', 'pkgName': 'wine', 'longDesc': u'Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux. Applications are run at full speed without the need of cpu emulation. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, however it can use native system dll files in place of its own if they are available.\n\nThis meta-package always depends on the latest version of Wine.'}}
