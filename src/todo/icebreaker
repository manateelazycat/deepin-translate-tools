{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Break the iceberg', 'pkgName': 'icebreaker', 'longDesc': u'So, uh, there\'s a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.\n\nIn order to trap the penguins, you\'ll need to break the iceberg into small chunks. (They\'re afraid of water, for no apparent reason. Ah well. "The Matrix" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.\n\nOnce 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than that, you\'ll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a. "score").\n\nSee also http://www.mattdm.org/icebreaker/'}}
